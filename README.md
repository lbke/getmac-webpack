# Getmac - webpack compatible

See https://github.com/bevry/getmac

This package is a copy of the sources of getmac 1.4.6 and its dependencies.
It allow importing with Webpack, that would otherwise fail due to the use of 
[bevry/editions](https://github.com/bevry/editions) for export.

This package won't be updated as it is used only for legacy support, please PR or fork if you want to improve it.
